                <h2>Who Was J.R.R. Tolkien?</h2>

                <p>J.R.R. Tolkien was an English fantasy author and academic. Tolkien settled in England as a child, going on to study at
                Exeter College. While teaching at Oxford University, he published the popular fantasy novels The Hobbit and The Lord of
                the Rings trilogy. The works have had a devoted international fan base and been adapted into award-winning blockbuster
                films.</p>

                <h2>Early Life and Family</h2>

                <p>John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was born in Bloemfontein, South Africa, on January 3, 1892, to Arthur Tolkien and Mabel
                Suffield Tolkien. After Arthur died from complications of rheumatic fever, Mabel settled with four-year-old Tolkien and
                his younger brother, Hilary, in the country hamlet of Sarehole, in Birmingham, England.</p>

                <p>Mabel died in 1904, and the Tolkien brothers were sent to live with a relative and in boarding homes, with a Catholic
                priest assuming guardianship in Birmingham. Tolkien went on to get his first-class degree at Exeter College,
                specializing in Anglo-Saxon and Germanic languages and classic literature.</p>

                <h2>World War I</h2>

                <p>Tolkien enlisted as a lieutenant in the Lancashire Fusiliers and served in World War I, making sure to continue writing
                as well. He fought in the Battle of the Somme, in which there were severe casualties, and was eventually released from
                duty due to illness. In the midst of his military service, he married Edith Bratt in 1916.</p>

                <p>Continuing his linguistic studies, Tolkien joined the faculty of the University of Leeds in 1920 and a few years later
                became a professor at Oxford University. While there he started a writing group called The Inklings, which counted among
                its members C.S. Lewis and Owen Barfield. It was also at Oxford, while grading a paper, that he spontaneously wrote a
                short line about "a hobbit."</p>

                <h2>Books: 'The Hobbit' and 'The Lord of the Rings'</h2>

                <p>The award-winning fantasy novel The Hobbit — about the small, furry-footed Bilbo Baggins and his adventures — was
                published in 1937, and was regarded as a children’s book, though Tolkien would state the book wasn’t originally intended
                for children. He also created more than 100 drawings to support the narrative.</p>

                <p>Over the years, while working on scholarly publications, Tolkien developed the work that would come to be regarded as
                his masterpiece — The Lord of the Rings series, partially inspired by ancient European myths, with its own sets of maps,
                lore and languages.</p>

                <img src="" alt="">

                <p>Tolkien released part one of the series, The Fellowship of the Ring in 1954; The Two Towers and The Return of the King
                followed in 1955, finishing up the trilogy. The books gave readers a rich literary trove populated by elves, goblins,
                talking trees and all manner of fantastic creatures, including characters like the wizard Gandalf and the dwarf Gimli.</p>

                <p>While Rings had its share of critics, many reviewers and waves upon waves of general readers took to Tolkien’s world,
                causing the books to become global bestsellers, with fans forming Tolkien clubs and learning his fictional languages.</p>

                <h2>Death</h2>

                <p>Tolkien retired from professorial duties in 1959, going on to publish an essay and poetry collection, Tree and Leaf, and
                the fantasy tale Smith of Wootton Major. His wife Edith died in 1971, and Tolkien died on September 2, 1973, at the age
                of 81. He was survived by four children.</p>

                <h2>Legacy and New Adaptations</h2>

                <p>The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings series are grouped among the most popular books in the world, having sold tens of
                millions of copies. The Rings trilogy was also adapted by director Peter Jackson into a highly popular, award-winning
                trio of films starring Ian McKellen, Elijah Wood, Cate Blanchett and Viggo Mortensen, among others. Jackson also
                directed a three-part Hobbit movie adaptation starring Martin Freeman, which was released from 2012 to 2014.</p>

                <p>Tolkien's son Christopher has edited several works that weren't completed at the time of his father's death, including
                The Silmarillion and The Children of Húrin, which were published posthumously. The Art of the Hobbit was published in
                2012, celebrating the novel's 75th anniversary by presenting Tolkien's original illustrations.</p>
